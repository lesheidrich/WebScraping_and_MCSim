Module: game_service.py

Module for building and managing basketball game simulations.

This module contains classes and functions for constructing and controlling the simulation of basketball
games.
It includes functionalities for simulating various aspects of basketball gameplay, such as shot attempts,
possession switches, and player selection during gameplay.

Classes:
    - GameBuilder: Constructs and manages game-related functionalities for simulating basketball games.

Dependencies:
    - random: Provides functions for generating random numbers used in simulations.
    - typing: Provides support for type hints.
    - model.teams.Teams: Represents basketball teams participating in the game.
    - controller.dto_sim.TeamBuilder: Constructs teams and retrieves game data for simulation.
    - simulator.tools.GameTools: Provides tools for simulating game events using weighted probabilities.

    Constructs and manages game-related functionalities for simulating basketball games.

    This class provides methods for simulating various aspects of basketball games, including shot attempts,
    possession switches, tip-offs, and player selection during gameplay.

    Attributes:
        db_host (Optional[str]): The database host.
        season (str): The season of the game.
        home_team (Teams): The home team participating in the game.
        away_team (Teams): The away team participating in the game.
        game_date (str): The date of the game.
        game_type (str): The type of game (e.g., regular, playoffs).

    Methods:
        __init__: Initializes a GameBuilder instance.
        simulate_stat: Simulates the success of a specified statistic for a group of players.
        shot_attempt: Simulates a shot attempt by selecting a player and determining the outcome.
        switch_possession: Switches possession from one team to the other.
        tip_off: Simulates the tip-off to determine which team starts the game with possession.
        in_current_play: Selects players involved in the offensive play of the current possession.
        on_court: Selects players currently on the court for a team.
        choose_player: Chooses a random player from a specified position in the roster.
