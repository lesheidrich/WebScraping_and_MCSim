Module: monte_carlo_test.py

Module containing unit tests for Monte Carlo simulations of basketball games.

This module provides a collection of test cases to verify the functionality of Monte Carlo simulations
for both regular season and playoff games.

Classes:
    - TestMonteCarlo: A TestCase class containing methods for testing Monte Carlo simulations.

Methods:
    - test_regular: Tests the successful return of plt.figure from a Monte Carlo regular game.
    - test_playoff: Tests the successful return of plt.figure from a Monte Carlo playoff game.
