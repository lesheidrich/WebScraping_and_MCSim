***This project serves as the practical implementation of my computer science BSc [thesis](https://github.com/lesheidrich/Thesis/blob/bf28caa3c3bd65426a2e8a63fd0e69c3d5d254b0/thesis_gwjz4t.pdf) at Eszterházy Károly Catholic University.***

# Project Description
The application utilizes web scraping services to construct a MySQL/MariaDB database of historic NBA game data from the early 1990s. Users can select any historic game in the provided range, and the Monte Carlo simulation will estimate the expected results from reconstructed data predating the match. Simulations run for a preset range of epochs. The simulation performs best between 5-10 thousand epochs.
