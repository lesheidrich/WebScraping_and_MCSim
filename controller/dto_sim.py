Module: dto_sim.py

Module for building team data to be used by Monte Carlo sim.

This module provides a class, `TeamBuilder`, for constructing team rosters by retrieving and processing game
data from a MySQL database. It utilizes individual game data to calculate player statistics and populate
roster positions accordingly.

Classes:
    - TeamBuilder: Class for building team data to be used by Monte Carlo sim.
    - Roster: Represents a team's roster.
    - Player: Represents a basketball player with stats built from the last 365 days of games.

Attributes:
    - pd: pandas library for data manipulation.
    - MySQLHandler: Custom module for handling MySQL database operations.
    - Teams: Enum representing basketball teams.

Usage:
    Example usage of `TeamBuilder` class:
    ```
    from datetime import datetime
    from model.db_handler import MySQLHandler
    import pandas as pd
    from model.teams import Teams

    # Initialize a TeamBuilder instance
    builder = TeamBuilder(db_host=None, season="1991-1992", team=Teams.from_short_name('CHI'),
                          game_date="1993-04-30", game_type="regular", h_or_a="home")
